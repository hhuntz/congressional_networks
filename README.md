Bill cosponsorship is one way in which members of Congress communicate with each other and various political operatives, with their constituents and the public more broadly, and with donors or prospective donors to their campaigns. Proposing or cosponsoring a proposed bill is a way of taking responsibility for the ideas therein; hence, cosponsorship signals political or ideological alignment, or at least collaboration, on the relevant issues in a bill. This report casts these connections between members as a network in which nodes represent members and the edges between them are weighted according to the frequency of cosponsorship. This network is then analyzed by standard quantitative network measures of each node, e.g., variations of connectedness and centrality, as well as by bipartisanship score, a new measure of how connected the member is outside of their own political party. This network data, aggregated at the member level, is then connected to other political and demographic information about each member; thus, these network and cosponsorship measures can be compared across political and demographic groups of members.

The data and code here support the analysis found in [this paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iXyDKIBOpaelFscCOGf-xeRlMRTJyJH_sEfQApfYgP4/edit?usp=sharing).
